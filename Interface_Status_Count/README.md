# Counting Interfaces Based on Their Status

This DS counts how many interfaces are administratively up vs. administratively down and how many are operationally up vs. operationally down. It also derives counts of "up/up", "up/down", "down/up", and "down/down", as well as percent of ports that are administratively up, percent that are operationally up, and percentage that are both administratively up and operationally up (up/up).
