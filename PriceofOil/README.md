# Current Oil Price per Barrel according to OilPrice.com
This DS does a raw screen scrape of the web page to grab the WTI and Brent crude oil prices. Since it's a screen scrape, any little change in their website has the ability to break this DS. Fear not though, because this means you'll get to brush up on your RegEx!
